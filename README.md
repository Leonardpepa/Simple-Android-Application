# Purpose
The purpose of the project is to make an introduction to the basics of android studio and android development so we can continue with more advanced topics

# Concepts
In this project we implemented a basic app that can show a toast message on the screen, a counter that increments a textView by 1 with each button click and
navigation from one fragment to another passing one argument the number of the counter so we can show a random number between that and 0. For the arguments 
we used a library called safeargs
